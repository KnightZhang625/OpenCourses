build a key/value storage system that "shards," or partitions, the keys over a set of replica groups.

A shard is a subset of the key/value pairs

Each replica group handles puts and gets for just a few of the shards, operates in parallel

Two main components:
	1. a set of replica groups: A replica consists of a handful of servers that use Paxos to replicate the group's shard
	2. shard master: Single, the shard master decides which replica group should serve each shard; this information is called the configuration

Clients consult the shard master in order to find the replica group for a key
Replica groups consult the master in order to find out what shards to serve.

Main challenge: handling reconfiguration in the replica groups

ensure that at most one replica group is serving requests for each shard

The shardmaster manages a sequence of numbered configurations. 

Each configuration describes a set of replica groups and an assignment of shards to replica groups



Each RPC handler on Shard master should put a reqID inside
